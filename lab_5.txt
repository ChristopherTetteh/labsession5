Git is a distributed version control system that
allows developers to manage changes to their code over time,
including tracking changes, creating branches,
and merging changes between branches. Git is a command-line 
tool that runs on your local machine and can be used for version control in any project, 
not just software development.

GitHub, on the other hand,
is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
It allows users to store their Git repositories in the cloud and collaborate with
others by sharing code and contributing to existing projects. GitHub also provides
a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, including pull requests, issues, and wikis.
